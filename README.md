#Calculator
This is a java application which parses mathematical expressions and evaluates the result.
It supports the use of standard arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /, ^), 
some functions (sin[], cos[], tan[], fct[]), setting variables, and much more!

##Sample Runtime
```
	?> 1 + 1
	=> 2.0
	?> 2 ^ (4 - 1)
	=> 8.0
	?> 2e3
	=> 2000.0
	?> x = 3!
	=> 6.0
	?> <x>^2 - <x> - 1
	=> 29.0
	?> y = 30
	=> 30.0
	?> sin[<y>]^2 + cos[<y>]^2
	=> 1.0
	?> exit
```
